## Introducing DiscordHub

Discord Hub is a new set of servers dedicated to giving Nitro Discord users loads of animated and funny emojis to use in any server. From explosions to parrot parties, you will find everything you need here.

## Why choose DiscordHub?

You should choose Discord Hub because of it's precision. We don't want tags, spam and moderation bots controlling our lives. We don't use text channels, we use private channels just for you to test the emojis in each server.

## Do I have to have nitro?

Unfortunately yes. Discord only allows Nitro users to use animated emojis, however each of our servers have regular emojis which can only be used in that server for non-nitro users.

## Do I require any personal information/data?

No, we only require you to join our discord servers. You don't even have to view them.

## I want to chat to other people!

At the current stage of our discord setup, we do not have talk channels in any of our servers. These could be an option in the future.

## Do you have global emotes?

No, we do not support GameWisp or any other "GW" emotes provider.
